Required package: requests, bs4, plotly, sqlite3
For the API used in my code to work, two access keys(one for Yelp fusion and another for mapbox access token)are required. I have uploaded ‘api.py’ which include my access keys. You are free to use it.
For the interaction, if you are use vscode, you should right click on the code and choose “run current file in interactive window’ to run my code because the graphs plotted by Plotly can only show in the interactive window. If you are using Jupyter notebook, you only need to run the code directly. For each of the question appearing the command line, you need to input your answers according to the instructions given.
